# maze.kt
A Kotlin port of [Hauberk's](https://github.com/munificent/hauberk) dungeon generator, 
as described in http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes.

The original implementation is in Dart; this is a more or less direct port to Kotlin,
with minor refactors for legibility and language idiomacy.
